# python_web_scraping_project

Overview
This project involves scraping movie data from a website using Python's Beautiful Soup library and an HTML parser. The goal is to collect information about 2000 movies, including movie name, duration, rating, director, genre, and release date. The extracted data is then processed and stored using the Pandas module for structured handling.
